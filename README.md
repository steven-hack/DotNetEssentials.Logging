# .NET Essentials - Logging in .NET

This repository contains the demo project discussed in Betatalks episodes #95 and #96. In these talks, we explore various aspects of logging in .NET, including logger messages, log properties, tag providers, redactors, and enrichers.

This demo project is an integral part of the two-part episode about Logging in .NET, hosted on YouTube. Make sure to watch these episodes to better understand the source code:

## Overview

Logging is an essential aspect of any software application as it helps in understanding application behavior, debugging issues, and monitoring performance. In the .NET ecosystem, logging is facilitated by various frameworks such as Serilog, NLog, and Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.

This project serves as a demonstration of best practices and essential techniques for effective logging in .NET applications using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.

## Features

- **Logger Messages**: Demonstrates how to create log messages using different severity levels (e.g., Information, Warning, Error) and structured logging.
- **Log Properties**: Shows how to attach additional properties or metadata to log messages for better categorization and analysis.
- **Tag Providers**: Illustrates the use of tag providers to dynamically enrich log messages with contextual information.
- **Redactors**: Explores techniques for redacting sensitive information from log messages to maintain data privacy.
- **Enrichers**: Demonstrates how enrichers can automatically add contextual information to log messages (e.g., timestamps, machine information).
